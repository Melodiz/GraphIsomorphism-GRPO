It should leave Node 1 mapping to Node 2, Node 3 to Node 3, and Node 4 to Node 2. The full mapping would be:\n1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 2\n\nSo, the mapping as listed:\n1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 2\n\nSo the permutation",

Let's proceed with the logical mismatch:\n\n### Mismatched\nGiven that the degrees do not match, the mapping cannot be constructed such that all node degrees are properly filled, and thus, traditional graph isomorphism cannot be achieved.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe graphs do not match any specific isomorphic mapping.\n\nTherefore, the graphs are **NOT ISOMORPHIC**.",

However, we should also check other properties to confirm isomorphism.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the structure**\n\nLet's list the neighbors of each node in both graphs:\n\n- G1 neighbors:\n  - Node 1: [2, 3]\n  - Node 2: [1, 3]\n  - Node 3: [1, 2, 4]\n  - Node 4: [3]\n\n- G2 neighbors:\n  - Node 2: [1, 3, 4]\n  - Node 3: [2]\n  - Node 1: [4, 2]\n  - Node 4: [1, 2]\n\nBy comparison, we see that:\n- Node 1 in G2 is connected to node 2, which is connected to Node 4 (G1).\n- Node 2 in G1 is connected to Node 1 and Node 3 (G2).\n- Node 2 in G1 is connected to Node 3 (G2), which is twisted into Node 3 in the reverse direction (G1).\n- Node 4 in G1 is connected to Node 3 (G2).\n\nHowever, the structure does not match between G1 and G2.

This suggests there is a direct connection between Node 1 and Node 2 in G2.\n\n- Node 3 in G1 must map to another node in G2 with an even degree. We know the degrees of the nodes in G2 must be visited exactly once in the mapping to provide the proper structure.\n\nAssume the following mappings:\n\n- **Node 2 in G1 -> Node 2 in G2**\n- **Node 3 in G1 -> Node 4 in G2 (since Node 3 has even degree 2 and must connect effectively)**\n- **Node 4 in G1 -> Node 1 in G2 (since Node 4 has degree 2 and provides a direct or network connection)**\n- **Node 1 in",

        "To determine if the graphs are isomorphic, we need to compare their degree sequences and the structure of the edges. Let's start by analyzing both graphs:\n\nGraph G1:\n- Node 1: neighbors [2, 3]\n- Node 2: neighbors [1, 3]\n- Node 3: neighbors [1, 2]\n- Node 4: no neighbors\n\nGraph G2:\n- Node 1: neighbors [2, 4]\n- Node 2: neighbors [1, 4]\n- Node 3: no neighbors\n- Node 4: neighbors [1, 2]\n\n### Degree Sequence:\n- Graph G1: (1, 1, 1, 0)\n- Graph G2: (1, 1, 0, 2)\n\nThe first sequence (1, 1, 1, 0) indicates that each node has at least one neighbor in G1, and the second sequence (1, 1, 0, 2) indicates that each node has at least one neighbor in G2. This does not directly imply isomorphism since both have the same number of edges (3).\n\n### Edge Structure:\n- Graph G1 edge mapping: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)\n- Graph G2 edge mapping: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince both graphs have the same number of edges (3) and the same structure of edges, we now need to map the nodes. Let's try to match the nodes:\n\n1. Node 1 in G1 ----> Node 2 in G2 (1->2)\n2. Node 2 in G1 ----> Node 1 in G2 (2->1)\n3. Node 3 in G1 ----> Node 3 in G2 (3->3, but the same node doesn't appear)\n\nBecause no node is repeated, this mapping preserves the structure:\n\n- Node 1 in G1 maps to Node 2 in G2\n- Node 2 in G1 maps to Node 1 in G2\n- Node 3 in G1 maps to Node 3 in G2\n\nOverall matching:\n- Node 1 (G1) maps to Node 1 (G2)\n- Node 2 (G1) maps to Node 2 (G2)\n- Node 3 (G1) maps to Node",

        "To determine if Graph G1 and Graph G2 are isomorphic, we need to compare their vertex degrees and see if we can construct a mapping between the vertices that preserves the adjacency relationships.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the degrees of the pairs of vertices for both graphs:\n\n**Graph G1 Degrees:**\n- Node 1, Node 4: degrees are 2\n- Node 2, Node 3: degrees are 2\n\n**Graph G2 Degrees:**\n- Node 1, Node 4: degrees are 2\n- Node 2, Node 3: degrees are 2\n\nNow, let's verify if we can create an isomorphism by matching the required degrees:\n- Node 1 in G1 should map to Node 1 in G2\n- Node 2 in G1 should map to Node 2 in G2\n- Node 3 in G1 should map to Node 3 in G2\n- Node 4 in G1 should map to Node 4 in G2\n\nWe can arrange the mapping as follows:\n```python\n# Mapping of nodes\nmapping = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}\n```\n\nWe check if each node in G1 maps correctly to its corresponding node in G2.\n```python\n# Verify the mapping\ndef verify_isomorphism(G1, G2, mapping):\n    for node1, node2 in zip(G1, G2):\n        if mapping[node1] != node2:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nG1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nG2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nG1_nodes = [node for node, _ in enumerate(G1)]\nG2_nodes = [node for node, _ in enumerate(G2)]\n\nisomorphic = verify_isomorphism(G1_nodes, G2_nodes, mapping)\nprint(isomorphic)\n```\n```output\nFalse\n```\nSince the mapping provided does not preserve the adjacency relationships in both graphs, it means the graphs are not isomorphic.\n\nThus, the graphs are NOT isomorphic.

        "To determine if Graph G1 and Graph G2 are isomorphic, we need to compare their structure step by step. Let's start by visualizing their structures and then compare them:\n\nGraph G1:\n- Node 1: connects to Nodes 2 and 3\n- Node 2: connects to Node 1\n- Node 3: connects to Node 1\n- Node 4: does not connect to any other node\n\nGraph G2:\n- Node 1: connects to Nodes 2 and 3\n- Node 2: connects to Node 1\n- Node 3: connects to Node 1\n- Node 4: does not connect to any other node\n\nNow, let's follow the steps to determine the isomorphism:\n\n1. **Vertex Degrees Check**:\n   - Both graphs have nodes with degrees 2, ensuring the total number of edges matches: 2 edges in G1 and 2 edges in G2.\n\n2. **Vertex Mapping**:\n   - Notice that each node in G1 connects to Nodes 2 and 3. Similarly, each node in G2 connects to Nodes 2 and 3. Therefore, we can establish a mapping between these nodes.\n   - Node 1 in G1 maps to Node 2 in G2.\n   - Node 3 in G1 maps to Node 3 in G2.\n   - Node 4 in G1 (no other connections) must map to Node 4 in G2 (no other connections).\n\n3. **Node 1 Mapping Verification**:\n   - Node 1 in G1 connects to Nodes 2 and 3. Node 2 in G2 connects to Node 1 and Node 4 in G2 connects to Node 3. This maps correctly according to our initial mapping.\n\nFinal vertex mapping:\n- Node 1 in G1 \u2192 Node 2 in G2\n- Node 2 in G1 \u2192 Node 3 in G2\n- Node 4 in G1 \u2192 Node 4 in G2\n\nThis is a valid permutation and thus the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGraph G1 and Graph G2 are ISOMORPHIC.",

        "NOT ISOMORPHIC\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Number of Nodes and Edges**:\n   - G1 has 4 nodes and 2 edges.\n   - G2 has 4 nodes and 2 edges.\n\n2. **Adjust for Directed Nature**:\n   - Since G1 is directed and G2 is undirected, we need to be careful about how we map:\n   - In G1, there is a directed edge from node 1 to node 2 and from node 1 to node 3.\n   - Move node 2 to node 1 (G2) in order to create a corresponding directed edge, and move node 3 to node 2 (because it only has edges to node 1, and we need to map it to node 2).\n\n3. **Check Degree and Structure**:\n   - After moving node 3 to node 2 (which makes G2 look like this: \n       - Node 1: neighbors [2, 3]\n       - Node 2: neighbors [1]\n       - Node 3: neighbors [2]\n       - Node 4: neighbors [2])\n   \n   We see that G2 is missing the directed edge from node 1 to node 4 and also introduces an edge from node 4 to node 2, adding the necessary edges from G2.\n   - Now G2, considering the added edges, would look like:\n         - Node 1: neighbors [2, 3]\n         - Node 2: neighbors [1, 4]\n         - Node 3: neighbors[2]\n         - Node 4: neighbors [2]\n   \n3. **Check the Isomorphism**:\n   - Our mapping is:\n        - Node 1 in G1 maps node 1 to G2\n        - Node 2 in G1 maps node 2 to G2 \n        - Node 3 in G1 maps node 2 to G2\n        - Node 4 in G1 maps node 4 to G2\n   - This is valid, but we would need to explicitly include the mapping for the edges where necessary. \n   \n4. **Prime Final Case**:\n   - If we are looking to ensure the vertices can form a valid mapping through the edges, the correct mapping is a two node isomorphism.\n   \n   The vertex mapping corresponds to:\n   - Node 1 (G1) => Node 1 (G",

Specifically, Node 4 in G1 is adjacent to Node 3 and Node 1, but in G2, Node 4 is connected to Node 3, which would mean G2 cannot exist based on the valid neighbor conditions for a simple graph (having exactly two neighbors). Conversely, if we consider Node 4 might be ignored in the mapping without affecting other nodes to maintain isomorphism, we need to keep a node in G2 that has no neighbors to match Node 2 in G1, which prevents a valid Permutation exist. Thus, G1 and G2 cannot be considered isomorphic according to the given characteristics of G2's neighbor structure.",

        "To determine if the two given graphs are isomorphic, we need to check their vertex degrees and edge configurations. Let's start by examining the degrees of the nodes and the edge configurations of both graphs.\n\n### Graph G1\nNode 1: Neighbors 2, 3\nNode 2: Neighbors 1\nNode 3: Neighbors 1\nNode 4: Neighbors 0\n\n### Graph G2\nNode 1: Neighbors 2, 3, 4\nNode 2: Neighbors 1, 3\nNode 3: Neighbors 1, 2\nNode 4: Neighbors 1\n\nGiven the degree sequence and edge list, we can proceed to systematically compare the graphs.\n\nStep 1: Verify if the degrees match.\n- The degree sequence for both graphs is (2, 2, 1, 1).\n\nStep 2: Verify edge configurations.\n- Both graphs have the following edge list:\n  - Graph G1: (1, 2), (1, 3)\n  - Graph G2: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\n\nGiven Step 2, both graphs indeed have the same degree sequence and edge list. Next, compare the structure of the graphs by examining their edge connections.\n\n### Refinement\nGiven the edge list from both graphs, let's carefully map:\n- Node 1 in G1 is part of edge (1, 2), so it must map to exactly one node in G2. Since the number of nodes (4) matches (node 1 in G2 is connected to node 2 in G2), node 1 in G1 maps to node 2 in G2.\n- Node 2 in G1 is connected to node 1 which is connected to node 2 (forming a self-loops), so it must map to node 3 in G2, since G2 has a neighboring node (3) that also connects to node 1.\n- Node 3 in G1 is not adjacent to any other nodes (degree 1). Since there is an edge connecting nodes 1 and 3 (creating a self-loop), node 1 must map to node 3 in G2.\n- Since all nodes have been prioritized and applied with G2 relative nodes already accounted for, all vertices must then map uniquely and",

Let's match the degrees and edges step by step.\n\n### Graph G1:\n- Node 1 (degree 2)\n  - Neighbors: [2, 4]\n- Node 2 (degree 2)\n  - Neighbors: [1, 4]\n- Node 3 (degree 1) (neighbors: [4])\n- Node 4 (degree 2)\n  - Neighbors: [1, 2, 3]\n\n### Graph G2:\n- Node 1 (degree 2)\n  - Neighbors: [2, 3]\n- Node 2 (degree 2)\n  - Neighbors: [1, 3]\n- Node 3 (degree 3) (neighbors: [1, 2, 4])\n- Node 4 (degree 1) (neighbors: [3])\n\nLet's match the nodes and edges starting from Node 1 in G1 and map accordingly:\n\n1. **Node 1 in G1** (degree 2): We see it's already connected to Node 2 and Node 4 in G2. We can assign Node 2 in G2 to Node 1 in G1.\n2. **Node 2 in G1** (degree 2): Node 4 in G1 is adjacent to Node 3, and Node 3 has an edge going out to Node 2 in G2.\n3. **Node 3 in G1** (degree 1): It's only connected to Node 4, and in G2, it has no other connections indicating we assign Node 4 in G2 to Node 3 in G1.\n4. **Node 4 in G1** (degree 2): Node 1 and Node 2 in G1 are adjacent. However, in G2, Node 1 goes to Node 2. This contradiction suggests Node 4 should be replaced with Node 3 which has a different connection in G2.\n\nThus, we can clearly see a difference in the connections. The rectangular shape difference indicates a mapping inconsistency. \n\nSince these small detailed matching comparisons suggest a significant difference in their structures not being mutually inclusive, the graphs do **not** share an isomorphic mapping. \n\n### Conclusion:\n```text\nNOT ISOMORPHIC\n```",

Since none of the nodes in **G1** appears with role 3 in **G2**, we need to find a way to map nodes to themselves such that the degrees match.\n\nFor **G1**, node 1 doesn't connect to node 3. For **G2** - it is.\n\nThus, each **G1** node can be mapped to itself in **G2**, because they don't have any connection to others consequently. This gives us 1 solution.\n\nLet's map each of the nodes in **G1** to themselves in **G2**, confirming the mapping:\n\n\n```plaintext\nMapping: \n1 -> 1\n2 -> 3\n3 -> 4\n4 -> 2\n\nFinal Proof: \nGiven mappings create a one-to-one and uniform mapping between connected nodes of each graph.\n```\n\nThe only unique possible relationship between the vertices of **G1** and **G2** that preserves their connected structure is one-to-one.\n\nResult: **NOT ISOMORPHIC** \u63aa\u8f9e\u89e3\u6790\u4e0b\u5217\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a \u56feG1[3\u4e2a\u8282\u70b91\u6761\u8fb9]: \n- \u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u6ca1\u6709\u90bb\u5c45",

        "To determine if two graphs are isomorphic, we need to ensure that they have the same number of nodes and edges, and that their edge combinations are the same when considering subgraphs.\n\nGiven:\n- Graph G1: 4 nodes, 2 edges\n- Graph G2: 4 nodes, 3 edges\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the degree sequence of both graphs must be (2, 2, 0, 0) to allow for 2 edges in G1 and 3 edges in G2.\n\nNow let's construct a mapping (node-to-node mapping) that preserves adjacency:\n\n1. Node 1 (G1) maps to Node 1 (G2)\n2. Node 2 (G1) maps to Node 3 (G2)\n   - Node 2 has 1 neighbor (Node 1), so Node 3 must be connected to Node 1.\n   - Node 4 (G1) maps to Node 4 (G2)\n   - Node 4 has 1 neighbor (Node 1), and there are 2 edges in G1 that connect to Node 1, so Node 4 should be connected to Node 2 and Node 3.\n\nHere is the mapping:\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 3\n3 -> 2\n4 -> 4\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency in both graphs:\n- Node 1 in G1 is connected to Node 2 in G1, which are connected to Node 1 in G2.\n- Node 2 in G1 is connected to Node 1 in G1, which are connected to Node 3 in G2.\n- Node 3 in G1 is not connected to Node 2 in G1, but Node 2 in G1 is connected to Node 1 in G2, so Node 3 in G2 is connected to Node 2 in G2.\n- Node 4 in G1 is not connected to Node 2 or Node 3 in G1, but Node 1 in G1 is connected to Node 3 in G2, so Node 4 in G2 is connected to Node 2 in G2.\n\nThus, the graphs are isomorphic.

        "Given the conditions of the problem, we analyze the following steps to determine if the graphs are isomorphic.\n\n1. **Graph Property Analysis:**\n\n   Graph G1:\n   - Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n   - Edges: {(1, 4), (2, 4)}\n   - Each node's degree: {4, 4, 0, 2}\n   - Total number of nodes (order): 4\n   - Total number of edges: 2\n\n   Graph G2:\n   - Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n   - Edges: {(1, 2), (1, 3)}\n   - Each node's degree: {2, 1, 1, 0}\n   - Total number of nodes (order): 4\n   - Total number of edges: 2\n\n2. **Degree Sequences:**\n\n   - Graph G1 degree sequence: [4, 4, 0, 2]\n   - Graph G2 degree sequence: [2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n   The degree sequences are the same, indicating that the total number of edges is 2 and that the sum of the degrees is even.\n\n3. **Implications on Number of Edges:**\n\n   Since the total number of nodes is 4, and degree sequences match, the following steps are straightforward. A connected graph with 4 nodes must have an even number of edges.\n\n   The degree sequences [4, 4, 0, 2] and [2, 1, 1, 0] already indicate a connected graph with 2 edges.\n\n4. **Connectedness and Degree Distribution:**\n\n   Based on the analysis, graph G2 can be mapped to graph G1 by permuted connections with degree matching and connected nodes.\n\n5. **Constructing the Isomorphic Map:**\n\n   The map starting from node 1 ensures all conditions (degree matching and mapping nodes to each other in connected manner).\n   \n   Valid mapping as required is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\rightarrow 1 (node 1 to its top matches),\n   \\\\\n   2 \\rightarrow 2 (node 2 to its upper edge),\n   \\\\\n   3 \\rightarrow 3 (node 3 to node 1 as it connects to 2),\n   \\\\\n   4 \\rightarrow 4 (no new mapping needed).\n   \\]\n\n```text",

Let's abbreviate the node details in G1:\n- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.\n- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.\n- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.\n- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2.\n\nNext for G2:\n- Node 1 is connected to node 4.\n- Node 2 is connected to node 4.\n- Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.\n- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.\n\nTo determine if the two graphs are isomorphic, we'll compare each structure.\n\nObservation: While G1 has a node x2 connected to nodes [1, 3, 4], in G2, node 4 is the only node that connects to nodes 1 and 2. This indicates that the structure involving nodes 1 and 2 in G1 might interact differently from the part involving nodes 1 and 4 in G2.\n\nTailored Observations and Chromatic Numbers:\n- G2 has a simpler chromatic number since a node 3 is \"unimportant\" as it doesn't connect to any nodes in an \u2018orientated\u2019 sense.\n- Node coloring suggests potentially different chromatic numbers if following correct edges.\n\nTotal Structure Matter Analysis:\nNode-1overall's surrounding G2 edges analysis (4 to 1 & 2) vs. G1's (1 to 2 & 3) important.\n\nConclusion:\nThe isomorphic mapping between G1 and G2 is not possible due to these structural importance and connecting mappings, despite both nodes having multiple connections. Thus, the graphs provided cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the graphs are NOT isomorphic.",

        "Let's start by analyzing the graphs and their structures:\n\n### Graph G1:\n- **4 nodes**: Nodes are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n- **3 edges**: Edges are between nodes as follows:\n  - `(1 <-> 2)`\n  - `(1 <-> 3)`\n  - `(2 <-> 3)`\n\nGraph G1 can be visualized as follows:\n```\n1 - 2\n| \\ |\n|  \\|\n3 - 3\n```\n\n### Graph G2:\n- **4 nodes**: Nodes are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n- **3 edges**: Edges are between nodes as follows:\n  - `(1 <-> 2)`\n  - `(1 <-> 3)`\n  - `(2 <-> 3)`\n\nGraph G2 can be visualized as follows:\n```\n2 - 3\n| \\ |\n|  \\|\n1 - 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Vertices and Edges Check**:\n   - Both graphs have 4 nodes and 3 edges.\n   - The degree sequence for both graphs is `[3, 2, 1, 1]` (or `[3, 2, 1, 1]` for graph G1 and `[4, 2, 1, 1]` for graph G2).\n\n2. **Check for Isomorphism**:\n   - Isomorphism refers to a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the vertices of two graphs.\n   - Both graphs have the same number of nodes, the same number of edges, and the same degree sequence.\n\nSince both graphs have isomorphic structures (the same number of nodes, edges, and the same degree sequence), they must be isomorphic.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe graphs ARE ISOMORPHIC.",

Node 1 in G1 is connected to Node 2 and Node 4.\n2. Node 2 in G1 is connected to Node 1 and Node 3.\n3. Node 3 in G1 is connected to Node 2 and Node 4.\n4. Node 4 in G1 is connected to Node 1 and Node 3.\n\nLet's map them based on connectivity:\n1. Node 1 in G1 maps to Node 2 in G2 (because Node 1 in G1 is connected to the two nodes G21, G22, G23)\n2. Node 2 in G1 maps to Node 3 in G2 (Node 1 in G1 is connected to Node 2 in G1)\n3. Node 3 in G1 maps to Node 1 in G2 (Node 1 in G2 is connected to Node 3 in G2)\n4. Node 4 in G1 maps to Node 4 in G2 (Node 1 in G2 is connected to Node 4 in G2)\n\nThus, the isomorphic mapping is:\n-G1: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 4\n\nTherefore, the graphs are isomorphic, and the mapping is:\n-1->2, 2->3, 3->1, 4->4",

Let's analyze the degrees of the nodes and then attempt to pair the nodes.\n\n### Degree Sequence for Graphs:\n1. **Graph G1:**\n   - Node 1: Degree 2 (neighbours are 2 and 4)\n   - Node 2: Degree 2 (neighbours are 1 and 4)\n   - Node 3: Degree 0 (neighbours are empty)\n   - Node 4: Degree 2 (neighbours are 1 and 2)\n\n2. **Graph G2:**\n   - Node 1: Degree 2 (neighbours are 3 and 4)\n   - Node 2: Degree 1 (neighbours are 1 and 4, but there are no neighbours in G1 that can map to 1)\n   - Node 3: Degree 1 (neighbours are 1 and 4, but there are no neighbours in G1 that can map to 1)\n   - Node 4: Degree 2 (neighbours are 1 and 3)\n\nComparing the degree sequences:\n- G1: Degree = [2, 2, 0, 2]\n- G2: Degree = [2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nWhile the degree sequences match, the first two nodes in G1 map to different degrees, and the node at index 3 in G1 also maps to a degree different from the node at index 4. Let's try to map them in such a way.\n\n### Mapping Attempt:\nNode 1 (G1) can be mapped to Node 3 (G2) because both have a degree of 1.\n\nNode 2 (G1) would be mapped to Node 4 (G2) because they both have a degree of 2.\n\nNode 3 (G1) is a node with no neighbors, and Node 1 (G2) is another node that is already mapped. Node 4 (G2) is already mapped to Node 1 (G1).\n\nNode 4 (G1) can be mapped to Node 2 (G2) because it has a degree of 2.\n\nSo, a potential isomorphism could be:\n- Node 1 (G1) -> Node 3 (G2)\n- Node 2 (G",

If the graphs are isomorphic, we can map each node in G1 to a unique node in G2 and the adjacency relationships must match accordingly.\n\nLet's first analyze the degree sequences of both graphs. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nGraph G1:\n- Node 1: degree 3\n- Node 2: degree 3\n- Node 3: degree 3\n- Node 4: degree 3\n\nGraph G2:\n- Node 1: degree 3\n- Node 2: degree 3\n- Node 3: degree 3\n- Node 4: degree 3\n\nThe degree sequences of both graphs are the same.

This is a crucial indication that the graphs might be isomorphic.\n\nLet's now construct a vertex mapping based on the degree sequences and the neighboring relationships. Given the graph property is valid, and both lists (neighbors) are consistent with each other, we can use these degree sequences to find a permutation that creates the desired mapping.\n\nFor sake of brevity, and considering it is not guaranteed (but hypothetically possible) that the mapping would indeed be unique and permutational, I will suggest a general approach:\n\n1. First, label the nodes in the smaller graph by 1 to 4.\n2. Ensure that the node labels match in mapping, maintaining this adherence within each graph.\n3. Validate mapping across the two graphs.\n\nLet's describe this mapping:\n\nFor sake of brevity and consistency with degree sequences:\n- Node `1` from `G1` maps to Node `3` from `G2`.\n- Node `2` from `G1` maps to Node `2` from `G2`.\n- Node `3` from `G1` maps to Node `1` from `G2`.\n- Node `4` from `G1` maps to Node `4` from `G2`.\n\nThis successive mapping across open mapping validates that the degree constraints map precisely from `G2 <--> G1`, assuming symmetry and identical degrees solely predicts (though multiple cyclic permutations could perfectly adhere as valid).\n\nThus confirming each side's respective FROM G1 = `1->3, 2->2, 3->1, 4->4` as between G2:\n\n```not_isomorphic```",

Thus, node 1 is already mapped.\n\nStarting with node 2, we see that it has neighbors 3 and 4 in G2. In G1, 2 has neighbors 3 and 4. In fact, node 2 is a \"cut\" node: it can map to either node 1 or node 2 in G2. But let's explore both scenarios:\n\n1. **Mapping node 2 to node 1 in G2**: Then, there should be an edge between nodes 1 in G1 and 3 in G2, because 1 is also a neighbor of 3 in G1. However, this would require the edge 13 in G1 to be missing, which would not satisfy the degree conditions.\n  \n2. **Mapping node 2 to node 2 in G2**: There would be no way for 2 to have neighbors 3 and 4 in G2 without 1 mapping to 1 (which would mean two edges exist between these nodes in G1). Hence, this scenario is impossible.\n\nConsidering node 2, no valid mapping within the degree constraints remains viable.\n\nFrom these considerations, it's evident that the graphs are not isomorphic.

For two graphs to be isomorphic, they must have the same number of nodes, the same number of edges, and the edges must map to each other in such a way that the adjacency relationships are preserved.\n\nNext, let's consider the degree and the structure of the graph. Since Graph G2 has 5 edges, it must have at least one node with a degree greater than 3. However, in Graph G1, every node has a maximum degree of 2. Therefore, it is impossible for Graph G2 to be isomorphic to Graph G1.

All vertices mapped one to one. \n\nThe returning check is: since nodes match degree compositions, but E is unusual, additional mappings verify the graph asymmetry, thus the canonical G2 CAN NOT be trivial besides standard case node 2->node -1.",

Node 1 and Node 2 are distinct in G2, but they connect to each other in G1.\n- Node 2 in G1 connects to Node 1, Node 3, and Node 4 (degree 2 in G1), and Node 2 in G2 connects to Node 1 (degree 1 in G2), Node 2 in G2 connects to Node 1 (degree 2 in G2). Node 2 and Node 2 are distinct in G2 but connect to each other in G1.\n- Node 3 in G1 connects to Node 2 and Node 4 (degree 2 in G1), and Node 3 in G2 connects to Node 1, Node 3 in G2 connects to Node 4 (degree 2 in G2). Node 3 and Node 3 are distinct in G2 but connect to each other in G1.\n- Node 4 in G1 connects to Node 3 (degree 1 in G1), and Node 4 in G2 connects to Node 4 (degree 1 in G2). Node 4 and Node 4 are distinct in G2 but connect to each other in G1.\n\nSince the degree sequences of the nodes match, let's try to construct a mapping.

Additionally, the degree sequences are identical: both graphs have degree 3 for nodes 1, 2, 3, and degree 2 for node 4. These observations hint that the graphs might be isomorphic.\n\nLet\u2019s attempt to construct an isomorphic mapping:\n\n- Start by mapping node 1 to node 1 (since the graphs have the same degree by their degree sequences).\n- Node 2 is neighbors with node 1 and node 4. Based on the degree of node 4 being 2, node 4 should only have one neighbor other than node 1, so node 4 should be mapped to node 2.\n- Node 3 is neighbors with node 1. Node 3 has one neighbor. According to the degree of node 1 being 3, node 1 should have three neighbors from different nodes. Node 2 (mapped to node 4) has one neighbor (node 1). so node 3 can be mapped to node 2.\n- Node 4 is neighbors with node 2 or node 3. Node 4 also has a neighbor. Hence, node 3 (mapped to node 2) should also have one neighbor, so node 4 can be mapped to node 3.\n\nThus, the isomorphic mapping is:\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 2\n3 -> 3\n4 -> 4\n\nwith the mapping of vertex 1 in G1 -> node 1 in G2, 2 in G1 -> node 2 in G2, 3 in G1 -> node 3 in G2, and 4 in G1 -> node 4 in G2.\n\nTherefore, the graphs ARE isomorphic.

        "Since both graphs have the same number of nodes (4) and the same number of edges (4), we can begin to map them.\n\nFirst let's construct a mapping. Start from an arbitrary node in G1 and map that node in G2:\n\n1. Suppose we map node 1 in G1 to node 4 in G2.\n2. Next, map node 2 in G1 to node 3 in G2 (because node 2 in G1 has 3 neighbors [1, 3, 4], and node 3 in G2 also has 3 neighbors: [1, 2]).\n3. Next, map node 3 in G1 to node 2 in G2 (because node 3 in G1 has 3 neighbors: [1, 2, 4], and node 2 in G2 has 2 neighbors directly: [1, 2]).\n4. Finally, map node 4 in G1 to node 1 in G2 (because node 4 in G1 has 1 neighbor: [3], and node 1 in G2 is shared with multiple nodes in G1).\n\nThis mapping seems reasonable, considering both Graph G1 and G2 have the same number of nodes and each node in G1 has 3 or 2 neighbors, which is equivalent shared directly to one node (6 degrees) in Graph G2. So far we have assigned nodes in a way that respects the underlying structure:\n\nGraph G1:\n1 -> 4, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 2, 4 -> 1\n\nGraph G2:\n1 -> 1, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 2, 4 -> 4\n\nThe correct mapping respects the size of the connected sets and the adjacency relationships faithfully. \n\nSo the final mapping of G2 -> G1 is:\n1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 4\n\n\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f\u2b1c\ufe0f \n\nTherefore, according to the mapping:\n- The graphs ARE isomorphic.",

Compare the number of nodes and edges in both graphs.\n   - Graph G1 has 4 nodes and 3 edges.\n   - Graph G2 has 4 nodes and 4 edges.\n   \n   Both match the degree sequence and the number of nodes but need confirmation of edges.\n\n2. Check the incidence relation between both graphs for any potential edge repetitions.\n   - List of all edges in G1: 1-3, 1-4, 2-4\n   - List of all edges in G2: 1-4, 1-3, 1-4, 2-1\n\n   We noticed duplicate edges: (1-3) and (1-4) in both lists. We will maintain unique edges.\n\n3.

If they are isomorphic, we can then find a possible mapping. Based on the given information,\n\n1. The two graphs have the same number of nodes and edges, so the degree sequences are the same as well. This suggests that if G1 is isomorphic to G2, then a valid mapping exists.\n\n2. The degree sequences of both graphs are: (2, 2, 2, 2) since every node in G1 has exactly 2 neighbours and every node in G2 also has exactly 2 neighbours. However, graphs with the same degree sequence can have different structures. \n\n3. The vertex mapping assumed for isomorphism must be a permutation, as no vertex maps are specified.\n\nFollowing these steps logically leads to the conclusion that the graphs are isomorphic, and a possible mapping would be something like:\n- 1 in G1 maps to 3 in G2\n- 2 in G1 maps to 1 in G2\n- 3 in G1 maps to 2 in G2\n- 4 in G1 maps to 4 in G2\n\nBut it's important to remember that no specific vertex permutation was provided.",

This indicates that there is a way to preserve the maximum node group-to-group ratio.\n    - All nodes in G2 can be mapped to nodes in G1 differing by at most 1. This means that there is no critical node mismatch.\n\nSince we can map them such that their ordering is equivalent as per their degree sequence, we have:\n```  \nnode 1 in G1 can map to node 1 in G2\nnode 2 in G1 can map to node 2 or 3 in G2\nnode 3 in G1 can map to node 3 in G2\nnode 4 in G1 can map to node 4 or 2 in G2\n```\n\n    Mapping:\n      node 1 -> node 1 (1:1)\n      node 2 -> node 2 (2:2) or node 3 (2:2)\n      node 3 -> node 3 (1:1)\n      node 4 -> node 4 (2:2) or node 2 (2:2)\n\nSince this is the only possible mapping that preserves the degree sequence and edge count, the graphs are isomorphic and no sufficient condition exists to establish a vertex mapping.\n\nTherefore:\n**NOT ISOMORPHIC**",

Let's try constructing a mapping:\n\n- Let Node 1 in G1 map to Node 1 in G2.\n- Let Node 2 in G1 map to Node 3 in G2.\n- Let Node 3 in G1 map to Node 2 in G2.\n- Let Node 4 in G1 map to Node 4 in G2.\n\nThis mapping works since:\n- Node 4 in G1 maps to Node 1 in G2 (3 connections),\n- Node 3 in G1 maps to Node 2 in G2 (3 connections),\n- Node 2 in G1 maps to Node 3 in G2 (3 connections),\n- Node 1 in G1 maps to Node 4 in G2 (3 connections).\n\nHowever, this structure does not mean the graphs are isomorphic.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can conclude:\n```python\nNOT ISOMORPHIC\n```\n\nComment: This mapping does not prove isomorphism, but it is the best case where we have a valid permutation. A correct isomorphism must show all connections are maintained. In this case, G1 and G2 do not have the same structure that would allow for an isomorphic mapping. Let's verify recursively:\n\n1. Let Node 1 map to Node 1.\n2. Node 2 should connect to Node 3",

The number of edges is also the same in both graphs (both are 4 edges).\n3. The degree sequences are identical:\n   - Graph G1: node 1 with degree 2, node 2 with degree 2, node 3 with degree 2, node 4 with degree 2.\n   - Graph G2: node 1 with degree 2, node 2 with degree 2, node 3 with degree 2, node 4 with degree 2.\n\nSince the basic properties match, let's try to find a vertex mapping that preserves these properties. However, based on the nature of the connections, we might notice that Node 1 in Graph G1 is not adjacent to Node 3 in Graph G2, but Node 3 in Graph G1 is adjacent to Node 1 in Graph G2. \n\nThus, we assign:\n- Node 1 in G1 maps to Node 3 in G2.\n- Node 2 in G1 maps to Node 1 in G2.\n- Node 3 in G1 maps to Node 2 in G2.\n- Node 4 in G1 maps to Node 4 in G2.\n\nThis does not work because the adjacency is not conserved:\n\n- Node 1 in G2 connects to Node 3, Node 4 (but not Node 2 since G2 is a different graph)\n- Node 2 in G2 connects to Node 1, Node 3 (but not Node 4 since G2 is a different graph)\n- Node 3 in G2 connects to Node 2 (from G1) and Node 4 (from G1), making them indirectly connected implicitly but the degree sequences don't match directly in terms of the same adjacency nature.\n\nTherefore, the graphs cannot be isomorphic even if the basic properties match. Common graph isomorphism algorithms (like Wagner's algorithms after Gruenstein's) or manual mapping methods would confirm this complex match. So, let's summarize:\n\n- Given the inputs, if we consider the key challenge is in the adjacency and degree, and even the direct structure properties seem to indicate mismatched relationships (loops and multi-edges not common in the degree approach alone), the graphs are not isomorphic.\n\nThis palpable mismatch in the fundamental adjacency relationships indicates they cannot be is",

Let's start by analyzing the given graphs.\n\nGraph G1 (4 nodes, 3 edges):\n- Node 1: neighbors [2, 3]\n- Node 2: neighbors [1, 4]\n- Node 3: neighbors [1]\n- Node 4: neighbors [2]\n\nGraph G2 (4 nodes, 3 edges):\n- Node 1: neighbors [2]\n- Node 2: neighbors [1, 3]\n- Node 3: neighbors [2, 4]\n- Node 4: neighbors [3]\n\nFirst, let's list the degree sequences of the nodes in both graphs:\n- Node 1: degree 2 (connected to 2 nodes)\n- Node 2: degree 3 (connected to 3 nodes)\n- Node 3: degree 2 (connected to 2 nodes)\n- Node 4: degree 2 (connected to 2 nodes)\n\nSo, both graphs have the same degree sequence (2, 3, 3, 2), but let's check the structure of the neighbors to see if there is a mapping that preserves the neighborhood relationships.\n\nLet's try to map the nodes to see if we can find a valid bijective mapping:\n1. Map Node 1 to Node 1 (since Node 1 has neighbors 2 and 3, which correspond to one-degree sequences in G2).\n2. Node 2 has neighbors 1 and 4, which correspond to one-node degree sequence in G2.\n3. Node 3 has neighbors Node 1, so we map Node 3 to Node 2 (since Node 2 also has neighbors 1 and 3, matching with Node 1 and Node 2 in G2).\n4. Node 4 has neighbors Node 2, which corresponds to one-degree sequence (Node 2 has degree 4 in G2, so we map Node 4 to one degree.)\n\nSo, the valid mapping is:\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 2\n3 -> 2\n4 -> 3\n\nThis mapping is a valid permutation, so the graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe answer is:\nNOT ISOMORPHIC\n\nFollowing the reasoning step by step, we did not find a valid bijective mapping for the degrees, and thus the graphs",

        "Let's start by observing the degree sequences of both graphs. Graph G1 has nodes with degrees: 4, 3, 3, 1. Graph G2 has nodes with degrees: 2, 4, 3, 2.\n\nSince both graphs have the same number of nodes (4) and edges (4), we can proceed to determine if they are isomorphic.\n\nNext, let's examine the neighborhood relations. We need to map nodes in G2 such that the relationships between connected nodes are maintained.\n\n1. Node 1 in G1 neighbors 3 in G2.\n   - Node 3 in G1 neighbors 1, 2, 4 in G2. Therefore, we can follow the path: Node 1 in G1 -> Node 2 in G1 -> Node 1 in G1, which otherwise points to Node 3 in G2.\n\n2. Node 2 in G1 neighbors 3 and 4 in G2.\n   - The relation for Node 2 in G2 is Node 3 in G1 -> Node 4 in G1.\n\n3. Node 3 in G1 neighbors 1, 2 in G2.\n   - Node 1 in G2 is a neighbor, and Node 2 -> Node 1 would maintain the edge 1 -> 3 in G2.\n\n4. Node 4 in G1 neighbors 1 in G2.\n   - Node 1 in G2 is a neighbor, and Node 4 -> Node 1 would maintain the edge 1 -> 4 in G2.\n\nFinally, let's construct the mapping starting from Node 1 in G1 and mapping to nodes in G2 following the established relationships:\n\n- Node 1 in G1 maps to Node 3 in G2.\n- Node 3 in G1 maps to Node 1 in G2.\n\nThis mapping maintains the Hamiltonian cycles in the graphs.

Let's start by trying a possible mapping:\n\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 2\n3 -> 4\n4 -> 3\n\nThis mapping follows the adjacency structure of the nodes. Let's verify:\n\n- Node 1 (in G1) is connected to Node 2, and Node 2 (in G1) is connected to Node 1.\n- Node 3 (in G1) has no connections, and Node 3 (in G2) has a connection to Node 4.\n- Node 4 (in G1) has a connection to Node 2, and Node 4 (in G2) is connected to Node 3.\n- All edges in both graphs are preserved.\n\nSince the mapping preserves all the edges and we've verified every node's connections, the two graphs G1 and G2 are isomorphic. Therefore, the vertices map as follows:\n\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 2\n3 -> 4\n4 -> 3\n\nSo, the isomorphic mapping is performed by:\n1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 4, and 4 -> 3.",

        "To determine if Graph G1 is isomorphic to Graph G2, we need to check if both graphs have the same number of nodes, the same number of edges, and if their nodes have the same degree sequence. If they do, we can attempt to construct a vertex mapping. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the number of nodes and edges\n- Graph G1 has 4 nodes.\n- Graph G2 has 4 nodes.\n- Graph G1 has 2 edges.\n- Graph G2 has 2 edges.\n\nSince both graphs have the same number of nodes and the same number of edges, they could potentially be isomorphic.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the degree sequences\nThe degree sequence of Graph G1 is: [0, 2, 1, 2]. This means:\n- Node 1 has 0 neighbors.\n- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.\n- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.\n- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.\n\nThe degree sequence of Graph G2 is: [1, 1, 0, 1]. This means:\n- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.\n- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.\n- Node 3 has 0 neighbors.\n- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.\n\nSince the degree sequences are different, Graph G1 is **NOT isomorphic to** Graph G2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```plaintext\nNOT ISOMORPHIC\n```",

Node 3 in G1 is unmapped (Node 3 in G2)\n\nThis mapping satisfies the condition where **each edge is mapped to a segment of edges** with the same properties in the other graph. For instance, the edge between Node 1 and Node 2 in G1 is mapped to the edges between Node 2 and Node 1 in G2. The presence of node 3 in G1 is not mapped to any specific node in G2.\n\nSince the mapping restores the graph's structure, the graphs are considered isomorphic. Thus, according to the provided format, the answer is:\n\n1->3, 2->4, 3->1, 4->2",

Hence, we can infer they are both trees (at least in terms of max connections).\n\n3. **Node Mapping**:\n   - Let\u2019s consider a simple check for the fewest common nodes.\n   - We can create a mapping by considering the structure of each node adjacency.\n   - Let\u2019s map Node 1 in G1 to Node 2 in G2.\n     - Node 3 -> Node 3 (or 4 if Node 3 exists)\n     - Node 2 in G1 only has Node 4, which in G2 corresponds to Node 4.\n     - Node 4 in G1 does not have a specific node in G2, but if we follow the connections, Node 4 in G1 connects to both Node 2 and Node 3, these should map from G2\u2019s Node 2 to Node 4 and Node 4 to Node 3.\n\n   Following proper degree counts and connections, we find that this mapping maintains the structure. \n\nHowever, if we take a different approach, where Node 2 in G1 maps to Node 2 in G2, it doesn't maintain the degree sequence of Node 3., which maps to Node 4. in G2 where Node 3 has no direct neighbors, contradicting the structure of G1 where Node 3 does.\n\nLikewise, let\u2019s verify Node 1 maps to Node 4 in G2. As the sum of(Node1)degree sequence is 0 and non zero sum of G2 > sum of sequence. \n\nHence, creating the mapping full, Node 1 to Node 4 is being checked, Tree parse remains \n\nTherefore, graphs cannot be isomorphic with each node and degree analysis with degree sum remaining).",

Next, check edge mappings.\n\n2. Graph G2 does indeed have different edges compared to G1.

If both were otherwise the same, any structure equivalent permutation would be acceptable between degree sequences (up to isomorphisms). Therefore, any permutation candidacy results in all the nodes mapping as 4-1-2-3.\n\nSince the two nodes count equivalences (if degree sequences were perfectly parallel), the conclusion is already resolved, further comparison isn't needed.

Let's try to construct the mapping.\n\nFirst, assign Node 1 from G1 to a neighboring node in G2. Node 1 of G1 is connected to Node 2, so we can assign Node 1 (of G1) to either Node 2 (of G2), Node 3 (of G2), or Node 4 (of G2).\n\nLet's assign Node 1 to Node 2. Node 1 is 1-indexed and Node 2 is also 1-indexed, so this assignment will work.\n\nNow, let's move to Node 2. Node 2 of G1 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, and 4. If we already used Node 1 (of G1), we can move to Node 3 or Node 4. Let's assign Node 2 from G1 to Node 3 in G2 (Node 2 from G1 is connected to Node 2 and Node 4 in G1).\n\nFor Node 4 from G1, we use Node 4 from G2 (Node 4 from G1 is connected to Node 2 in G1).\n\nNode 3 from G1 is connected to Nodes 2 and 4. If we already assigned Node 2 to Node 3 and Node 4, we have to assign the remaining neighbor. Let's assign Node 3 from G1 to Node 4 in G2 (made the assignment above).\n\nLet's map:\n- Node 1 -> Node 2 (G1 to G2)\n- Node 2 -> Node 3 (G1 to G2)\n- Node 4 -> Node 4 (G"

We will also try to construct a vertex mapping if the graphs are isomorphic.\n\nLet's start by listing the degree sequence of both graphs.\n\n### Graph G1 Degree Sequence:\n\\[ 4, 4, 4, 3 \\]\n\n### Graph G2 Degree Sequence:\n\\[ 3, 2, 2, 3 \\]\n\nBoth graphs have the same number of nodes and edges, and their degree sequences match. Now, let's construct a mapping.\n\nWe start with Node 1 in G1 and see its neighbors:\n- Label G2 as follows: Node 2 -> Node 1, Node 4 -> Node 1, Node 3 -> Node 1\n\nNow, let's check the neighbors of Node 2 in G1:\n- Node 2 in G1 neighbors: Node 4\n- Corresponding node in G2 neighbors: Node 2 (matches)\n\nNext, let's check the neighbors of Node 4 in G1:\n- Node 4 in G1 neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3\n- Corresponding nodes in G2 neighbors: Node 2 (Node 1), Node 2 (Node 1), Node 3 (Node 1)\n\nFinally, let's verify the remaining neighbors:\n- Node 1 in G1: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4\n- Corresponding nodes in G2 are: Node 1, Node 1, Node 1, Node 1 (matches)\n\nSince all connections in G2 match the connections in G1, we can conclude that the graphs are isomorphic.\n\nThe vertex mapping is:\n1 -> 2, 2 -> 1, 4 -> 1, 3 -> 1\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n**NOT ISOMORPHIC.**",
