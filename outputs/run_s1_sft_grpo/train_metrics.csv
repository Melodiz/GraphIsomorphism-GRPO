Node 1 in G1: corresponds to Node 1 in G2 (always)\n2. Node 2 in G1: corresponds to Node 5 in G2\n3. Node 3 in G1: corresponds to Node 6 in G2\n4. Node 4 in G1: corresponds to Node 7 in G2\n\nNow, let's check the adjacency conditions:\n- Node 5: neighbors [6, 7, 8] (since Node 1: [2, 3, 4] in G2, and Node 5 is adjacent to Node 1)\n- Node 6: neighbors [5, 7, 8] (since Node 2: [1, 3, 4] in G2, and Node 6 is adjacent to Node 2)\n- Node"", 'To determine whether the graphs are isomorphic, we will calculate their degree sequences and node degree sequences and compare them.\n\n1. **Degree Sequence Calculation**:\n   - **Graph G1**:\n     - Node 1: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4)\n     - Node 2: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4)\n     - Node 3: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4)\n     - Node 4: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3)\n   \n     Thus, the degree sequence of G1 is \\( (2, 2, 2, 2) \\).\n\n   - **Graph G2**:\n     - Node 1: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4)\n     - Node 2: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4)\n     - Node 3: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4)\n     - Node 4: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3)\n   \n     Thus, the degree sequence of G2 is \\( (2, 2, 2, 2) \\).\n\n2. **Node Degree Sequence Calculation**:\n   - **Graph G1 Pre-order (Degree of node 1):**\n\n     - Node 1: Degree = 2\n     - Node 2: Not considered directly\n     - Node 3: Not considered directly\n     - Node 4: Not considered directly\n\n   - **Node Degree Sequence in G1**:\n     Node 1 has 2 connections to each node (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n   - **Graph G1 Post-order (Degree of node 1):**\n     Node 2 has 2 connections to each node (1, 3, 4).\n\n   - **Node Degree Sequence in G1**: \\( (1, 2) \\)\n\n   - **Node Degree Sequence in G2**: \\( (1, 2) \\)\n\n3. **Node Degree Sequence for Immediate Neighbors of Node 1**:\n   - After getting the immediate neighbors for each position, we see they are the same in both G1 and G2.\n\nSince the degree sequences match and the immediate neighbors of node 1 are also the same, we can infer that', ""To determine if the given graphs are isomorphic, we need to compare their structures by analyzing their node degrees and the local structures of each node.\n\nFirst, let's list the degrees of each node in both graphs:\n\n**Graph G1:**\n- Node 1: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4)\n- Node 2: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4)\n- Node 3: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4)\n- Node 4: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3)\n\nAll nodes have degrees of 2, so we move to the next step.\n\n**Graph G2:**\n- Node 1: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4)\n- Node 2: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4)\n- Node 3: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4)\n- Node 4: degrees: 2 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3)\n\nBoth graphs are identical in terms of node degrees.\n\nNext, let's consider the local structures of each node.

Edge [1->4] in G1 maps to [1"", ""We need to determine if graphs G1 and G2 are isomorphic. To do this, we compare their degree sequence and structure.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Degree Sequence\n- The degree sequence is the sorted list of degrees of all nodes in the graph. For both G1 and G2, the degree sequence (without repetition) is [1, 1, 1, 4].\n\nThis indicates that both graphs have nodes of degree 1 (all first-degree vertices) and a node of maximum degree 4 (node 4 in both).\n\n### Step 2: Constructing a Mapping\nGiven that both graphs have identical degree sequences, there is potentially a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between the nodes of the two graphs.\n\nLet's try to construct a possible mapping:\n1. Map node 1 in G1 (with degree 2 + 4 - 2 = 4) to node 1 in G2.\n2. Map node 2 (degree 2) to a node with degree 2, such as node 2 in G2.\n3. Map node 3 (degree 2) to a node with degree 2, such as node 3 in G2.\n4. Map node 4 (degree 4) to itself (node 4 in G2).\n\nReviewing the positions in G2:\n- Node 2: neighbors [1, 3, 4]\n- Node 3: neighbors [1, 2, 4]\n- Node 4: neighbors [1, 2, 3]\n\nThe mapping seems to work with:\n- Node 1 (degree 4) to Node 1\n- Node 2 to Node 2\n- Node 3 to Node 3\n- Node 4 (intermediate node with degree 4 left) to Node 1\n\nGiven this mapping is a 1-to-1 correspondence, it preserves the structure of the graphs. The edges match as well:\n- Node 1: neighbors [2, 3, 4]\n- Node 2: neighbors [1, 3, 4]\n- Node 3: neighbors [1, 2, 4]\n- Node 4: neighbors [1, 2, 3]\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the graphs have similar structures and the mapping preserves the degree sequence and the structure of nodes and edges, we have proven that G1 and G2 are isomorphic.\n\n**NOT ISOMORPH"", 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'Graph G1 and Graph G2 are isomorphic.

It has 2 edges and the remaining neighbors are Node 2 and Node 4. We can map Node 2 to Node 1 in G2 and Node 4 to an unassigned node, but since Node 3 is a neighbor of Node 1 in G1, it must map to a node in G2 that is also a neighbor of Node 1. The only available node is Node 3.\n\n- **Map Node 1 to Node 1 in G2**: Node 1 in G1 is already mapped to Node 1 in G2.\n\n- **Map Node 2 to Node 1 in G2**: Node 2 is mapped to Node 1 in G2.\n\n- **Map Node 3 to Node 2 in G2**: Node 3 is mapped to Node 2 in G2.\n\n- **Map Node 4 to an unassigned node**: Since Node 4 has only 1 edge and no neighbor other than Node 2, it cannot be directly mapped.

This is a crucial start: if two graphs have the same number of nodes and edges, they must be isomorphic. Now, let's check the degree sequences to ensure they match. The degree sequence is the sequence of numbers indicating the number of neighbors each node has in a graph:\n\n- Degree of Node 1 in G1: 2\n- Degree of Node 2 in G1: 2\n- Degree of Node 3 in G1: 3\n- Degree of Node 4 in G1: 3\n- Degree of Node 1 in G2: 3\n- Degree of Node 2 in G2: 3\n- Degree of Node 3 in G2: 3\n- Degree of Node 4 in G2: 3\n\nSo both graphs G1 and G2 have the same degree sequence (2, 2, 3, 3).\n\nSince the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the degree sequences match, the graphs must be isomorphic. The mapping between the nodes should be a valid permutation, where each node in G1 is mapped to a unique node in G2 in such a way that preserved the original graph's properties.\n\nTo construct this mapping, we need to ensure that each node in G1 maps to exactly one node in G2 and that the adjacency conditions are preserved. Let's briefly construct the mapping \\( \\phi \\):\n\n- Node 1: mapped to Node 3\n- Node 2: mapped to Node 4\n- Node 3: mapped to Node 1\n- Node 4: mapped to Node 2\n\nThis mapping satisfies the conditions:\n- Node 1 is mapped to Node 3 (in G1, Node 1 has exactly 2"", 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC']",613804.0,39.5625,7.0,512.0,0.0625,8.066667556762695,7.0,38.0,-0.875,0.2199706733226776,-0.875,0.2199706733226776,0.0,39.5625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.504,63,,,,,

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Number of Nodes and Edges:**\n   - Graph G1 has 4 nodes and 3 edges.\n   - Graph G2 has 4 nodes and 5 edges.\n\n   This immediately indicates a crucial difference: G2 has one more edge than G1.\n\n2. **Degree Sequences:**\n   - The degree sequence of G1 is: 2, 3, 2, 3\n   - The degree sequence of G2 is: 2, 4, 4, 3\n\n   The degree sequences are not identical, slightly differing in the counts of three nodes (node 2 in G1 has a degree of 3, and node 2 in G2 also has a degree of 3), and the maximum degree of G2 is larger. This slight discrepancy in the roles of node 2 is relevant.\n\n3. **Graph Structure and Edge Mapping (Degree Ends):**\n   - Node 1 can only match with Nodes 2 or 3 in G2 since these are the only ones (node 4 would be a different degree pair-wise).\n   - Node 2 must map one of the remaining degrees from G2. Nodes 4 and 3 share the same end in G2 (both have a degree of 4 for mapping to node 2 in G1), but G2 doesn't know if 4 or 3 maps to higher degree in G1 unless specified. Given there are 3 edges leading to 3 distinct ends (2, 4, 3), we deduce G2 is a loop at 2 (G2 leaves 2 remaining with only two degrees), plausible for one that has loops. G2 is cyclic around 2.\n\n4. **Consistent Mapping Considering (loop at 2):**\n   - Node 4 must map uniquely.\n   - Node 3 uniquely contributes to the degree gap already established by G1 but tied exclusively into G2.\n   - Assign node 4 in G1 shoots a degree into G2 too, 3, which paired with another from G2 trend back into G1 distinguish.

We start from node 1 because all nodes have distinct degrees. Consider the following steps:\n\n1. Note that node 1 has a degree of 2, so it must be mapped to node 2 or node 3 or node 4.\n2. Notice that node 2 (degree 3) must be mapped to a node with at least 2 neighbors, and it must have a degree of 1. \n3. When we look at node 3 (degree 2), we see that its only neighbors are nodes 1 and 2. \n4. It only remains to map node 4 (degree 2) to nodes 1 or 2, and we can add one neighbor to each necessary mapping of node 4 to maintain its degree.\n\nObserving this and logic:\n- **Mapping node 1** to node 2, since node 1's neighbors must also map to nodes in G2.\n- **Mapping node 4** to the remaining node, node 3 (since both 1, 2 have already a mapping and no contradictions after).\n\nThus, the chosen mapping is:\n1 -> 2\n2 -> 1 (start mapping),\n3 -> 2 (node 3 maps with 2 neighbors already mapped: 1, 2 already with node 1 given)\n4 -> 3\n\nThus, these mappings satisfy all conditions along with the correct vertex degree and neighbor relations linearly.

If the adjacency matrices match, the graphs are isomorphic. If they don\'t match, the graphs are not isomorphic. This step-by-step evaluation aligns with the guidelines by focusing on the structural properties and leveraging Python to compute the adjacency matrices appropriately.', 'NOT ISOMORPHIC', 'To determine if the graphs G1 and G2 are isomorphic, let\'s follow the steps outlined below:\n\n1. **Identify the Degree Sequences**:\n   - Graph G1: Nodes: [1, 2, 3, 4], Degree seq: [3, 2, 2, 1]\n   - Graph G2: Nodes: [1, 2, 3, 4], Degree seq: [3, 1, 2, 2]\n\n2. **Compare the Degree Sequences**:\n   - Degree-sequence of G1: Decreasing [3, 2, 2, 1]\n   - Degree-sequence of G2: Decreasing [3, 1, 2, 2]\n\nSince both degree sequences match, but the degree sequences are decreasing, this means that a single way of mapping them is not possible. We need to check for a transposition that could be the original mapping.\n\n3. **Transform Graph G1**:\n   - If we swap nodes 1 in G1 with node 3, we get:\n   \n     Let\'s see if G2 can be obtained from G1 this way.\n\n     **Transformed G1 Graph**:\n       - Node 1 -> Node 3 (from G1)\n       - Node 2 remains as is (no change needed)\n       - Node 3 -> Node 4 (from G1)\n       - Node 4 no longer existing but the edge going out of 4.\n   \n     **Transformed Degree sequence remaining the same but we need to validate**:\n     The transformed graph will be something like this:\n         Node 1 -> Node 3\n         Node 2\n         Node 3 -> Node 4\n\n     This indicates the direct mapping between the nodes.

Then 1 is already adjacent to nodes 2, 3, 4 in G1, and these nodes must map to 2 in G2, forming the relations 1->2, 2->3, 2->4. However, in G1, node 4 is not adjacent to node 1 but to node 2, and in G2, node 4 is only adjacent to node 1. This violates the adjacency conditions.\n     - Suppose we map 1 in G1 to 3 in G2.

However, since the problem states that the graphs are the same, we need to find a way to map them that respects the adjacency constraints.\n\nAlso, let's examine graph G2, which is a n-ary graph, meaning that apart from node 1, node 2, and node 3, there are multiple edges.
